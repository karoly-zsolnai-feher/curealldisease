This is a fun, inspirational project tracking one of the most ambitious goals of our time: curing all diseases with AI within a decade, a challenge posed by DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis.

But this page has a twist.

**It tracks progress on two fronts:**
1.  **Biomedical Progress:** The content assesses our journey towards curing disease.
2.  **AI Progress:** The site itself is a benchmark. The entire `index.html` file—its code, design, research analysis, and even this text—is generated by a large language model.

It's a living document showcasing AI's ability to not only analyze a complex goal but also to creatively communicate it.

## Check Back Often!

This page will be periodically regenerated by the LLM. As AI models become more capable, you can expect this site to evolve in:

-   **Design & Code:** The layout, styling, and code quality will improve.
-   **Research Analysis:** The insights will become deeper and more nuanced.
-   **Creativity:** The overall presentation will become more engaging.

This repository is a snapshot of what AI can do today on the path to what it might do tomorrow.
